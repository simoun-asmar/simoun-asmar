# Hi, I’m Simoun Asmar 👋

Welcome to my GitHub! I’m a dedicated and curious Data Analyst passionate about turning raw data into meaningful insights. I’m currently building real-world projects that combine SQL, Python, Tableau, and Google Sheets — all focused on solving business problems with data.

---

##  What I’m working on
- Designing and documenting SQL-based analytics workflows  
- Building interactive dashboards in Tableau  
- Automating tasks and data pipelines with Python  
- Exploring advanced techniques in cohort and marketing analytics

##  Current Focus
- **SQL** – Query optimization and data modeling  
- **Python** – Data wrangling and automation  
- **Tableau + Power BI** – Effective visual storytelling  
- **Google Sheets** – Smart functions for fast analysis  
- **BigQuery + Fivetran** – End-to-end data integration workflows  
- **Databricks** – Analyzing and visualizing data in the cloud  
- **dbt** – Transforming and testing data at scale
- **AWS** – Launching EC2 instances, configuring security groups and VPCs, hosting static websites on S3, managing RDS databases  
- **Terraform** – Writing Infrastructure as Code to automate AWS deployments

## 🔧 Also diving into Cloud Engineering
Alongside my data work, I’m building practical experience in **Cloud Engineering**, focusing on deploying real infrastructure with AWS.  
So far, I’ve:
- Deployed EC2 instances and hosted full websites on them  
- Used the AWS CLI to manage services directly  
- Configured S3 buckets to host static websites  
- Set up RDS instances for PostgreSQL  
- Created infrastructure setups with **Terraform**  
- Managed access and permissions using **IAM**

I’m expanding into this space to bridge analytics with scalable, production-ready infrastructure.

## 👀 A little about me
When I’m not analyzing data, I’m either improving a dashboard, testing a new SQL trick, or helping others understand how to turn numbers into decisions.

## 🌟 Want to see the story behind the data?
Data is more than just numbers—it's about telling a story. And what better way to tell that story than through **interactive dashboards**?
