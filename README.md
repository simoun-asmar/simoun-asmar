# Hi, I’m Simoun Asmar 👋

Welcome to my GitHub! I’m a dedicated and curious Data Analyst passionate about turning raw data into meaningful insights. I’m currently building real-world projects that combine SQL, Python, Tableau, and Google Sheets — all focused on solving business problems with data.

##  What I’m working on
- Designing and documenting SQL-based analytics workflows  
- Building interactive dashboards in Tableau  
- Automating tasks and data pipelines with Python  
- Exploring advanced techniques in cohort and marketing analytics

##  Current Focus
- **SQL** – Query optimization and data modeling  
- **Python** – Data wrangling and automation  
- **Tableau** – Effective visual storytelling  
- **Google Sheets** – Smart functions for fast analysis  
- **BigQuery + Fivetran** – End-to-end data integration workflows

- **dbt** – Transforming and testing data at scale

## 👀 A little about me
When I’m not analyzing data, I’m either improving a dashboard, testing a new SQL trick, or helping others understand how to turn numbers into decisions.
